Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
What is the significance of OpenAI's extraction function in langchain's tagging process?

### Response:
OpenAI's extraction function plays a crucial role in langchain's tagging process. It takes in the input string along with the defined schema. The extraction function then interprets the string and tags it based on this schema, extracting the defined properties from your text input. This extraction function works hand in hand with the large language model and the tagging chain to achieve this.
