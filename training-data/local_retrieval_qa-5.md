Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library and the previously initialized GPT4All LLM, run a LLMChain operation using a PromptTemplate and retrieve documents.

### Response:
```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What are the main concepts in the retrieved document: {docs}"
)
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

question = "Discuss Deep Learning architectures"
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question)
result = llm_chain(docs)

result["text"]
```
