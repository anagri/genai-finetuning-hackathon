### Task 1: Analyze the use case and understand the workings of langchain library

The langchain library provides tools for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and is especially useful to handle long texts and documents. The use case provided explains how to summarize documents using this library. It offers three main approaches:

- `Stuff`: This method involves putting all documents into a single prompt and passing it to the LLM for summarization.
 
- `Map-reduce`: This method involves summarizing each document individually and then combining those summaries into a final summary.

- `Refine`: This method involves looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer.

Langchain allows customization of these processes by changing LLMs, prompts, and templates. It's helpful for managing large texts within the constraints of the token limits on the LLMs.

### Task 2: Prompt samples

### Instruction:
Load the url "https://example.com/post" using WebBaseLoader.

### Response:
```python
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://example.com/post")
docs = loader.load()
```
