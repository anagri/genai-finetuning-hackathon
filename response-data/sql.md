Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, query a SQLite database named `Chinook.db` and get the total number of employees in the database.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain

# Initializing the SQLite database
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

# Initializing the OpenAI model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True)

# Creating an SQLDatabaseChain instance
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)

# Querying the database
result = db_chain.run("How many employees are there?")
```

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, create a SQL query from a user question in natural language, "How many employees are there in the organization?".

### Response:
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase

# Initialize the database 
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

# Create query chain
chain = create_sql_query_chain(ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), db)

# User question 
question = "How many employees are there in the organization?"

# Building the SQL query based on a user question
response = chain.invoke({"question": question})
sql_query = response
```

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, interact with a SQL Database using sql agents created with the 'ChatOpenAI' model and get description of specific 'playlisttrack' table.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase

# Initialize the database 
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

# Create sql agent
agent_executor = create_sql_agent(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    toolkit=SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)),
    verbose=True,
)

# Obtaining description of the 'playlisttrack' table
response = agent_executor.run("Describe the playlisttrack table")
```
