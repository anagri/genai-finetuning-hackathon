Sure, I'll provide you with some example prompts created by using the instructions provided. 

Prompt #1
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, create an extraction model that extracts different parts from a user query related to a short story, specifically the conflicted character, setting, and resolution of the conflict.

### Response:
```python
import os
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain

# Set API Key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'your-openai-key'

# Schema
schema = {
    "properties": {
        "conflicted_character": {"type": "string"},
        "setting": {"type": "string"},
        "resolution": {"type": "string"},
    },
    "required": ["conflicted_character", "setting", "resolution"]
}

# Input 
inp = """In a small village in England, John, a kind-hearted farmer was always in conflict with his greed. One day, he found a treasure in his field. He donated all his wealth to the village and lived happily ever after."""

# Run chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
chain = create_extraction_chain(schema, llm)
chain.run(inp)
```

Prompt #2
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, parse the output of language model for a joke including setup and punchline fields by creating a custom pydantic class.

### Response:
```python
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser

# Pydantic data class
class JokeSchema(BaseModel):
    setup: str = Field(description="setup of the joke")
    punchline: str = Field(description="punchline of the joke")
    
# Parser
parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=JokeSchema)

# Prompt
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Tell a joke.\n{format_instructions}\n",
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()},
)

# Run model
joke_query = "Tell me a joke."
_input = prompt.format_prompt(query=joke_query)
model = OpenAI(temperature=0)
output = model(_input.to_string())
parser.parse(output)
```

This is a sample of how to generate prompts by replacing the entities in the use case with similar entities from a knowledge base. The steps can be repeated to generate more prompts.
