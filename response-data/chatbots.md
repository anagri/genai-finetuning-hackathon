Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the python langchain library, create a chat interface using a plain chat model that will respond to a user message.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.schema import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage
)
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat([HumanMessage(content="Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming.")])
```

---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Modify the previous chat interface from langchain library to remember past user inputs and model outputs by wrapping the chat model in a ConversationChain.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat)
conversation.run("Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming.")
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Setup a memory system using ConversationBufferMemory from the langchain library for your chatbot.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message("hi!")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message("whats up?")
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the Langchain library, extend your memory system to keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Extend your memory system from the LangChain library to create a summary of the conversation over time using ConversationSummaryMemory.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"},{"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "im working on better docs for chatbots"},{"output": "oh, that sounds like a lot of work"})
memory.save_context({"input": "yes, but it's worth the effort"},{"output": "agreed, good docs are important!"})
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Derive a more complex chat interface using the Langchain library, which includes a memory, ConversationSummaryMemory, and a custom prompt.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.prompts import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    MessagesPlaceholder,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI()

# Prompt 
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    messages=[
        SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
            "You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history"),
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template("{question}")
    ]
)

# Memory
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm, memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory)

conversation({"question": "hi"})
conversation({"question": "Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."})
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Combine chat with document retrieval from the LangChain library to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on.

### Response:
```python
!pip install tiktoken chromadb
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

loader = WebBaseLoader("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/")
data = loader.load()
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Store the document into a vector using the Chroma method from the langchain library.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Use the langchain library to add intelligence to your chatbot so it can retrieve accurate information while holding a conversation.

### Response:
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

llm = ChatOpenAI()
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory)
qa("How do agents use Task decomposition?")
```

---
---
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Using the langchain library, query the intelligent chatbot for various ways to implement memory to support it.

### Response:
```python
qa("What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?")
```
